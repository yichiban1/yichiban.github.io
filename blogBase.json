I took the video of the scenery on the tram. I used to live in the suburbs, so I was far away from the school. So I didn't know what to take a video of, so I took a video of the scenery outside the tram windows.\n\nDoria took a video of the state library and Julie took a video of her desk at home.\n\nSome brief reflections on that process\n\nI think the videos I shoot are boring, only the scenery. Maybe I need something more interesting. This requires me to learn editing skills like other video bloggers.\n\nAiming for\n\nI hope that one day I can learn more practical skills so that one day I can watch more of my own videos at least I won\u2019t be bored. But I\u2019m lazy so I hope I can do it one day.\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1723352129, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "createdDate": "2024-08-11", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P7": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/Homework Tasks -Week 2, Session 1.html", "labels": ["blog"], "postTitle": "Homework Tasks -Week 2, Session 1", "postUrl": "post/Homework%20Tasks%20-Week%202%2C%20Session%201.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/yichiban1/yichiban.github.io/issues/7", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 1788, "description": "![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/201a6e0e-e47f-4325-9513-2097feb6c519)\n\nThe first shot is from the shoes in the crowd, switching to my shoes, In my opinion, this is a kind of continuity. For example, the pen in my hand when the pen fall the light turns green.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7919596-aa6e-4d4a-90ba-448f4bfaa5b4)\n\nWhen the green light comes out, I write something in my notebook and then connect with some conceptual stuff.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b6cd667-aa65-4242-8763-85a2074fd722)\n\nThe third picture I wanted to express a sense of discontinuity, similar to a jump cut, but the final result might not be very good. The content is mainly about me going out.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69270626-cb47-46ea-a08a-5a75d58f7fa9)\n\nThe fourth photo shows my hobbies: playing chess, cooking, and drinking mate. I also occasionally go out for a walk. I hope to show a calm emotion, so the movements are usually fixed or the movements are relatively small.\n\nQuestion:The editing method influences the main themes, concepts, actions and feelings I want to present to the viewer ?\n\nAnswer: I want to give people a sense of calmness, so the movements are not big during the shooting. But in the middle part, I want to show the dynamics, so I want to create a sense of discontinuity. At other times, I basically hope that the video editing is logical, that is, to maintain coherence. There are also some conceptual things, such as green plants and sunshine. I hope there is a meaning in them, perhaps growth or simply to tell the viewer that it is dawn.\n\n(Sorry, professor, if you see this, I need to say sorry because my storyboard is really bad I'm not used to drawing on the computer.)\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1723370171, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "createdDate": "2024-08-11", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P8": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/Homework Tasks - Week2, Session 2.html", "labels": ["blog"], "postTitle": "Homework Tasks - Week2, Session 2", "postUrl": "post/Homework%20Tasks%20-%20Week2%2C%20Session%202.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/yichiban1/yichiban.github.io/issues/8", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 2265, "description": "Question: Key moments in the two-minute video ?\n\nAnswer: As the creator of this video, I like the beginning and the end of this video. If I have to choose, I would choose the end because if possible, I hope that the viewers will think that this is an interesting idea when they see the end.\n\nQuestion: How I planing to use Sound design and soundtrack to construct this moment ?\n\nAnswer: At the end I took videos of the lake, the temple, the flowing water and finally I wrote down my expectations for the future.\n\nSo these are all calm shots. I used ambient sounds and slow guitars to create a balance between the audio and visual elements. The sound of water, wind, and the sound of a book closing are all elements.\n\nQuestion: Emotional tone How editing will support that tone?\n\nAnswer: The coherent editing and emotional tone are what I want to present. I hope that people who watch my video will at least feel relaxed when watching my video, so I don\u2019t want the ending to be illogical, so I hope that there won\u2019t be any particularly fast-cut editing at the end.\n\nQuestion: The relationship between the shots I want to establish?\n\nAnswer: For me, the relationship between shots is important. If the continuity of the shots is disrupted, the video will feel weird. So I hope that each shot or the next shot is logical and does not make people feel out of place.\n\nQuestion: Trying to establish the rhythm beat speed editing how to produce this effect?\n\nAnswer: At the end, I hope to make a fade-out with the I close the book, and there is also the sound of running water. I want to make a G cut. I hope the ambient sound can give people a feeling of comfort and texture.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a76838e-8039-46b4-b9ff-f57285bb04c4)\n\nThe first shot of the hand lying on the bench by the sea with ambient sound and background music.\n\nThe second shot is the sound of returning home and throwing keys on the table.\n\nThe third shot is the sound of brewing yerba mate tea and background music.\n\nThe fourth shot Go game ambient sound and fade-in.\n\nThe fifth shot is the sound of cooking and background music.\n\nThe sixth one I put my hands together \ud83d\ude4f There is no ambient sound because it is too noisy outside, so there is only background music.\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1723373715, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "createdDate": "2024-08-11", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}}, "singeListJson": {}, "labelColorDict": {"blog": "#0052cc", "bug": "#d73a4a", "documentation": "#0075ca", "duplicate": "#cfd3d7", "enhancement": "#a2eeef", "good first issue": "#7057ff", "help wanted": "#008672", "invalid": "#e4e669", "question": "#d876e3", "wontfix": "#ffffff"}, "displayTitle": "Yichiban's Go", "faviconUrl": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "primerCSS": "<link href='https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/cdnjs/ajax/libs/Primer/21.0.7/primer.css' rel='stylesheet' />", "homeUrl": "https://yichiban1.github.io/yichiban.github.io", "prevUrl": "disabled", "nextUrl": "disabled"}
