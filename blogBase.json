I took the video of the scenery on the tram. I used to live in the suburbs, so I was far away from the school. So I didn't know what to take a video of, so I took a video of the scenery outside the tram windows.\n\nDoria took a video of the state library and Julie took a video of her desk at home.\n\nSome brief reflections on that process\n\nI think the videos I shoot are boring, only the scenery. Maybe I need something more interesting. This requires me to learn editing skills like other video bloggers.\n\nAiming for\n\nI hope that one day I can learn more practical skills so that one day I can watch more of my own videos at least I won\u2019t be bored. But I\u2019m lazy so I hope I can do it one day.\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1723352129, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "createdDate": "2024-08-11", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P7": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/Homework Tasks -Week 2, Session 1.html", "labels": ["blog"], "postTitle": "Homework Tasks -Week 2, Session 1", "postUrl": "post/Homework%20Tasks%20-Week%202%2C%20Session%201.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/yichiban1/yichiban.github.io/issues/7", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 1788, "description": "![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/201a6e0e-e47f-4325-9513-2097feb6c519)\n\nThe first shot is from the shoes in the crowd, switching to my shoes, In my opinion, this is a kind of continuity. For example, the pen in my hand when the pen fall the light turns green.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7919596-aa6e-4d4a-90ba-448f4bfaa5b4)\n\nWhen the green light comes out, I write something in my notebook and then connect with some conceptual stuff.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b6cd667-aa65-4242-8763-85a2074fd722)\n\nThe third picture I wanted to express a sense of discontinuity, similar to a jump cut, but the final result might not be very good. The content is mainly about me going out.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69270626-cb47-46ea-a08a-5a75d58f7fa9)\n\nThe fourth photo shows my hobbies: playing chess, cooking, and drinking mate. I also occasionally go out for a walk. I hope to show a calm emotion, so the movements are usually fixed or the movements are relatively small.\n\nQuestion:The editing method influences the main themes, concepts, actions and feelings I want to present to the viewer ?\n\nAnswer: I want to give people a sense of calmness, so the movements are not big during the shooting. But in the middle part, I want to show the dynamics, so I want to create a sense of discontinuity. At other times, I basically hope that the video editing is logical, that is, to maintain coherence. There are also some conceptual things, such as green plants and sunshine. I hope there is a meaning in them, perhaps growth or simply to tell the viewer that it is dawn.\n\n(Sorry, professor, if you see this, I need to say sorry because my storyboard is really bad I'm not used to drawing on the computer.)\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1723370171, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "createdDate": "2024-08-11", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}}, "singeListJson": {}, "labelColorDict": {"blog": "#0052cc", "bug": "#d73a4a", "documentation": "#0075ca", "duplicate": "#cfd3d7", "enhancement": "#a2eeef", "good first issue": "#7057ff", "help wanted": "#008672", "invalid": "#e4e669", "question": "#d876e3", "wontfix": "#ffffff"}, "displayTitle": "Yichiban's Go", "faviconUrl": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "primerCSS": "<link href='https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/cdnjs/ajax/libs/Primer/21.0.7/primer.css' rel='stylesheet' />", "homeUrl": "https://yichiban1.github.io/yichiban.github.io", "prevUrl": "disabled", "nextUrl": "disabled"}
