But in the middle part, I want to show the dynamics, so I want to create a sense of discontinuity. At other times, I basically hope that the video editing is logical, that is, to maintain coherence. There are also some conceptual things, such as green plants and sunshine.

I used ambient sounds and slow guitars to create a balance between the audio and visual elements. The sound of water, wind, and the sound of a book closing are all elements.\n\nQuestion: Emotional tone How editing will support that tone?\n\nAnswer: The coherent editing and emotional tone are what I want to present.

This is actually more difficult than I thought. How to express the natural movements of the hands and how to express the changes of light and shadow on the hands?\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6fd8b10-b95c-4e94-ad32-05e095ffb566)\n\nOf course, it is best to present it naturally, but I have to put the phone in a stable position to shoot. I actually have a lot of things I want to present, but it is difficult for me to do it at this stage. Just like the directors in the movies, they can shoot the hands like ballet dancers, so the movement of the hands is a problem for me.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff0f7e2c-b0a0-4094-b519-cfa59349af39)\n\nThe topic of hands is also very interesting to me because I remember that AI-made paintings and videos often make mistakes on hands. Michelangelo's oil painting Creation of Eve, Adam's outstretched fingers represent what it means to me is a beginning and a connection, so I hope that my hands in the video can also have a meaning, just like a fist \ud83d\udc4a can represent courage and anger, the hands I present in the video are more like representing myself, my emotions, and my feelings.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef77b095-c11e-46da-9b2f-4cdced69020c)\n\nAnd this is D\u00fcrer's Praying Hands \ud83d\ude4f A very important painting in art history.

The PlayStation system icon has simple lines that can tell the user what the icon is used for. I also thought of an icon for the weather app, but there are only a few types of weather, such as sunny, rainy, snowy, cloudy, etc. The other one is a game icon. I actually like this idea very much. I even drew a rough sketch. But recently I tried it and found that it is too difficult for me to challenge the game icon at my current level.\n\nSo recently I thought of social networking apps. Actually I think this is not bad. We use it almost every day. Think about the billions of people who use social networking apps in the world. What a huge user group. As for why I chose this theme, system, I think we use these apps every day, but when we are used to using it, we will forget about these icons and just rely on our subconscious to react to them. So I think you must be an excellent designer\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfa8to be able to make this feeling. Different functions in the app can become icons, so I want to design icons for it. The specific platform is the mobile phone. The background is some basic functions. The audience on the social networking app I hope is everyone, regardless of gender, age or young, but I hope the icon design is a little more interesting, so it may also be more inclined to a slightly younger group.\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1724064840, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "createdDate": "2024-08-19", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P12": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/Homework Tasks - Week 4, Session 2.html", "labels": ["blog"], "postTitle": "Homework Tasks - Week 4, Session 2", "postUrl": "post/Homework%20Tasks%20-%20Week%204%2C%20Session%202.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/yichiban1/yichiban.github.io/issues/12", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 3987, "description": "Thumbnail Sketching Activity\r\nThis is the yerba mate\ud83e\uddc9cup I drew\r\n\r\nI like the second bird's-eye view.

You can post comments on WeChat, publish videos, and earn revenue from content creation.\uff08WeChat is more like WhatsApp plus PayPal plus Instagram plus Twitter As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, WeChat's monthly active users reached 1.336 billion\uff09\n\nFor the whole set of icons, I hope to give people a friendly feeling, so I will avoid making icons with edges and corners. Icons with arcs or round shapes will be better.\n\nAt the same time, texture is also what I want to emphasize. After all, it is a great thing\ud83e\udd29to be able to express the texture of an icon through the screen.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3101445-ed8d-4a04-8fb9-c8eb3035124c)\n\nRegarding file backup, many companies also like to use the cloud. Maybe they want users to think that their backups are in the cloud\u2601\ufe0f, so they are safer. So I hope to clearly describe the feeling of uploading and downloading. In the end, I may choose the one with the upload symbol\u261d\ufe0f.\n\nRegarding searching, I have looked for some inspirations online or simply looked at the designs of some companies, but most of them are magnifying glasses\ud83d\udd0d, which is a bit boring. And I can't think of a particularly good alternative\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. So I might replace it in the end. Maybe it would be nice to make a folder icon to go with the file back up.\n\nIf possible, I would like to use horizontal lines for the contact icon because it gives people a sense of stability. The contact icon should contain our relatives and friends, so if possible, avoiding overly square lines is also an option. It is also good to have some arcs or give some round feeling. I may choose the first icon.\n\nThe collection icon contains things we like or find useful, so it can be interpreted as a desire for knowledge. Vertical lines can be a kind of usage element. Its characteristic is demanding of attention. After all, we will definitely look for the content again after we collect\ud83c\udf1fit. I might do the first one.\n\nRegarding information icons, the first thing that comes to my mind is diagonal lines because it is energetic, implying impending change. We always have expectations and uneasiness about unknown news, so diagonal is a good choice. I might make it the fifth one.\n\nRegarding the album icon, there are many styles when I was looking for it, such as a colorful windmill with a certain degree of transparency and a simple landscape outlined by lines. I want to use straight lines and some curves to depict the mountains. There is a small\ud83d\uddfbhill behind the mountain with a sense of\ud83c\udf06sunset, and maybe a small sun on it.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c814eb0-4a8c-465c-bca2-d2513944c405)\n\nThe discover icon is essentially to check the latest updates from friends, so there are many things that can represent the\ud83e\uddedcompass and the mysterious\ud83d\udce6box. However, I want to use a curve to draw the planet icon because it gives people a feeling of exploring in space, and it would be best if it has a ring like Saturn\ud83e\ude90, so I should choose the fourth one.\n\nRegarding wallets, I think the most commonly used\ud83d\udc5dwallet is the best representation. A slight curve can bring a sense of calm to the wallet icon. After all, everyone hopes that the money in their wallet is\ud83d\udcb3safe. I might choose the fifth one.\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1724317612, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "createdDate": "2024-08-22", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P13": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/Homework Tasks - Week 5, Session 1.html", "labels": ["blog"], "postTitle": "Homework Tasks - Week 5, Session 1", "postUrl": "post/Homework%20Tasks%20-%20Week%205%2C%20Session%201.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/yichiban1/yichiban.github.io/issues/13", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 933, "description": "4 Icons with 16 total colour variations.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29587fc3-82cc-4718-b2d4-c572c0b75e60)\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/297d0137-c6c0-4434-b7f9-0c0bb4a8b263)\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3caf7394-9943-4f4a-aa25-a3e8e14c76aa)\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a53f4a9d-076c-428b-9967-8bbfa3631722)\n\nI prefer the color scheme of Monochromatic because the keyword of the theme I want to design is system.\n\nMy goal was to design a set of icons that were consistent, simple, and focused on functionality, so the Monochromatic color scheme was a great choice.

Based on the needs analysis, after thinking about the overall style of the icons, I decided to adopt a simple and modern design to ensure that the icons are clearly identifiable under different backgrounds and conform to the overall aesthetic of the system application theme. There is also a basic color scheme. I decided to use gradient colors and soft color schemes to create a sense of depth visually while avoiding too strong color contrast to ensure that the entire set of icons can be harmoniously integrated into the interface.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3ebf9ef-f329-43d0-9c81-14e7740698e3)\n\uff08Just like this feeling, I also searched a lot on the Internet\uff09\n\nAfter that comes the preliminary design, which I sketch in my notebook to make sure the icons are visually consistent and convey their respective functions.\n\nThen the detailed design is to further refine the details of the icon.

I basically spent 17 to 18 years there. I went through a lot of changes in those two years. I first lived in a small Italian town with a population of only 20,000 people for a year.\n\nSmall transformation I think it was the movie Chungking Express and some black and white movies. Since then, I have become interested in the filming techniques and stories of movies.\n\nI haven't figured out the medium transformation yet.\n\nI hope the material can give a certain sense of reality and let people feel the texture.\n\nI hope to use the sounds that we are familiar with in our daily lives, such as the sound of wind and grass, to give people a sense of harmony.\n\nI also made a small sketch for this map of mine\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc92819f-a933-402f-9a82-eb0eae1aac9d)\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1725890591, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "createdDate": "2024-09-09", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P18": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/Homework Tasks - Week 7, Session 2.html", "labels": ["blog"], "postTitle": "Homework Tasks - Week 7, Session 2", "postUrl": "post/Homework%20Tasks%20-%20Week%207%2C%20Session%202.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/yichiban1/yichiban.github.io/issues/18", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 2346, "description": "For assignment 3, my final choice should be Akira Kurosawa's movie Ran. \uff08Akira Kurosawa shot four unique color films\uff09\r\n\r\n![\u5c4f\u5e55\u622a\u56fe 2024-10-03 220454](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34c690ce-5e55-4fd4-a60c-6ac66fe0fca4)\r\n\r\nKurosawa's movies actually gave me a lot of inspiration. When I was in junior high school, I actually liked watching movies. At first, it was Hollywood special effects movies, then art films, and then black-and-white movies. The first black-and-white movie I watched was actually Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars (Italian: Per un pugno di dollari). When I finished watching it, I felt that black-and-white movies were actually quite good, not as boring as I thought. Then I saw some comments on the Internet saying that this movie was actually plagiarized from Kurosawa's Yojimbo (Japanese: \u7528\u5fc3\u68d2,). So these movies reshaped my view of them.\r\n\r\n_ \u201cCreation is equivalent to memory. Creation is produced from memory and cannot be created out of nothing\u201d_\n\nI think these big and small things have also changed me from beginning to end. I remember a director once said that movies extend our lives three times. Maybe this is why I like movies and games.\n\nI don't want players to feel lost when playing my game because I always get lost in 3D linear games, so reasonable path planning is necessary.\n\nAs I sketched before, I hope that the player can see the main object as soon as he enters. Just like Mario wants to save the princess and Frodo wants to drop the ring, they both have a clear destination (the castle), so enlarging the main object in proportion is what I will do.\n\nWhen it comes to the design of the path, it can be a loop, a snake, a circle, or even a straight line, but I want it to be simple yet not simple, so maybe like the sketch I drew, I will put the main object in a higher position.\n\nFinally, let's talk about landmarks and navigation. To be honest, I don't want my 3D environment to have clumsy big red arrows. Even in the last century, those game makers would not do that. So I hope that my 3D environment has some vitality, so that players can feel the existence of wind, just like in Kurosawa's movies. And I can also use grass to avoid using roads, let grass grow on both sides and leave the middle empty. In this way, even without conspicuous road signs, we can know where the road is.\n\n\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1726404902, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "createdDate": "2024-09-15", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P19": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/Homework Tasks - Week 8, Session 1.html", "labels": ["blog"], "postTitle": "Homework Tasks - Week 8, Session 1", "postUrl": "post/Homework%20Tasks%20-%20Week%208%2C%20Session%201.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/yichiban1/yichiban.github.io/issues/19", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 1956, "description": "Some sketches I drew about scenes from the movie Ran\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89d7c041-b058-43fc-abf1-0df16b9bfe34)\n\nIn fact, there is no strict standard or rule to define the quality of a scene. Most of the time, people only rely on their own vision, hearing, taste, smell and touch, which are the five senses. Of course, the five senses are felt in real life. When the scene is put on the screen, things will change, right? You can place different objects in an old house and reflect the changes when the player walks through different positions. You can also bring some tranquility to the players and the experiencer in the open fields or grasslands.\n\nThe sense of direction is innate to humans. Of course, this is also the judgment made by humans based on their understanding of the scene. So, as I just said, the meaning of the scene also affects the player's judgment. For example, when we are in the parking lot, our first goal when we enter is to find a parking space and find an empty space. When we want to leave the parking lot, we will look for the place where we came in (exit) again.\n\nSo what I have to do is not to do things that go against common sense, that is, to let players understand the sense of space of the scene at a glance. Light and shadow and size can all limit and define the scene, so place different objects around the main object or highlight it as the main object. I hope that the main object gives people a sense of being high above, so using the surrounding objects to set it off is also something I will do. In addition, we can also make some changes to the road, such as making the road from narrow to wide or adding some doors. Through the perspective of the door, you can also see the existence of the main object.\n\nI think I will try to follow the sketch I made earlier to create a sense of space.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7067bf7d-7507-4d59-98a1-3b0df28fc3e3)\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1726568555, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "createdDate": "2024-09-17", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P20": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/Homework Tasks - Week 8\uff0cSession2.html", "labels": ["blog"], "postTitle": "Homework Tasks - Week 8\uff0cSession2", "postUrl": "post/Homework%20Tasks%20-%20Week%208%EF%BC%8CSession2.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/yichiban1/yichiban.github.io/issues/20", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 2194, "description": "Regarding music, I think music is of great significance to the 3D environment, which will make the scene less boring and more emotional.\n\nI added a song to the whole scene (Tsushima Suite: V. Seiiki). It's a good song that can show the mood. Because I think the way my transformation is presented is not these online models, but the different colors shown every time I pass through the scene, from black and white to a little red and then to color. For me, these may be more representative of my own transformation. The online models are more for the atmosphere of the whole scene.\n\nI hope that when the player's experience changes, it will also be accompanied by a transition in the music. So for me, this is a good song. I have tried playing it at a normal speed and it can match the beat.\n\nWhen I was writing this blog, I was actually thinking about the transformation expressed in the scene and my choice. I don\u2019t think it was a bad choice. In fact, when I first went to university in Italy, I accidentally chose the film major. I thought it would be cool to be a director at the time, but I changed my major after a few days and then the matter was never resolved. So sometimes I wonder what I am doing if I am still studying film. So when it comes to transformation, other ideas have emerged in my mind, but the idea of \u200b\u200bmaking a movie scene that I like and how its director changed my view of movies has not changed, so I did this. I always don\u2019t know what to choose and what to do, or I am a person who has ideas in vain.\n\nBack to the point, just having a background music is not enough, so I also put some small sound effects on the torii to enhance the feeling of transformation. And I put different sounds of wind chimes and Buddhist bells in different torii, because the color tone of walking out of the torii is the same, and what it represents must be the same.\n\nFinally, I added some sound of running water beside the waterfall, because Kurosawa's films always have mountains, rivers, and clouds. I don't really want to add too much sound, because keeping it natural is also a way for me. Adding too much sound, if not controlled well, will make the scene noisy and disorderly\ud83c\udfb6.\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1726993688, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "createdDate": "2024-09-22", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P21": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/Homework Tasks - Week 9, Session 1.html", "labels": ["blog"], "postTitle": "Homework Tasks - Week 9, Session 1", "postUrl": "post/Homework%20Tasks%20-%20Week%209%2C%20Session%201.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/yichiban1/yichiban.github.io/issues/21", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 1777, "description": "Unfortunately, I was a bit slow and my file was a bit large. Unity Play supports a maximum of 200MB, so I recorded a screencast for my family.\n\nThey think the whole process went smoothly without any major problems. Of course, the whole environment is still far from good.\n\nThere are still many details to be adjusted, such as the interaction of objects. If possible, it would be better to make some enterable houses or buildings. The beauty of the model placement needs to be further improved. In addition, the ups and downs of the terrain in the whole scene can be made more exaggerated, such as cliffs, so that the scene will be more impactful. From the feedback\n\nFor me personally, I feel that I have not been able to do it at this stage and I feel regretful about it. Like I said before, I have always wanted to add a wind navigation. As long as I press a certain button, the wind will guide the direction, thereby driving the interaction of objects in the entire scene. Also, if the leaves are swaying in the wind while the wind is blowing, the scene will be taken to a higher level. There is another point that I have not done, which is the weather. At the beginning, I actually wanted to set it to rainy day at the beginning, but because of my ability, I was not able to realize it in the end. The last point is also a pity for me. I actually wanted to make some differences in the character animation at the beginning, middle and end. For example, at the beginning, it walks slower or even crawls forward, becomes faster in the middle but still slower, and finally there is a change in color and the character's footsteps become lighter. This is actually an effect I want to achieve, but unfortunately, at this stage, I am not capable enough to achieve such an effect.\n\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1727866571, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "createdDate": "2024-10-02", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P22": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/Homework Tasks - Week 10, Session 1.html", "labels": ["blog"], "postTitle": "Homework Tasks - Week 10, Session 1", "postUrl": "post/Homework%20Tasks%20-%20Week%2010%2C%20Session%201.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/yichiban1/yichiban.github.io/issues/22", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 6700, "description": "Answer the self reflection questions \r\n\r\nAssignment 1 - Video Edit\r\n\u2022 How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of\r\nyour edit?\r\n\r\n\u2022 In videos, sound is used to provide emotions and make the audience feel present, such as the texture of some objects matching a video clip, such as what the sound of keys dropped on a table should be, and some L cuts and J cuts. When the video switches to a new scene, the audience already has an expectation of what is about to appear through the audio. J cuts help create a sense of anticipation and smoothly guide the audience from one scene to another. They are often used to introduce new characters or scenes. L cuts help maintain continuity between scenes and make transitions more natural. They are often used to keep the dialogue flowing or show what is mentioned in the dialogue.\r\n\r\n\u2022 How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?\r\n\r\n\u2022 How to use video to create a self-portrait was a big problem for me at that time because I was no different from others, maybe there were some minor differences, so it was hard for me to figure out how to present my own uniqueness. I shot about 60 clips at that time. I really went to many places in those three weeks because I really didn\u2019t know what to shoot, so I went out to look for it. My video clips might be when I was walking on the street and suddenly I thought of an idea and shot it. All my materials were shot in Melbourne. I think it was more like an adventure because I had just arrived here.\r\n\r\n\u2022 What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how\r\ndid you apply this knowledge to your project?\r\n\r\n\u2022 Sound is an important factor in the video. I hope it is non-narrative but also can provide strength to the video. In my video, I use L cut and J cut as well as some daily sounds such as washing hands, washing dishes and opening doors to enhance the texture of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use\r\nthese concepts to shape your use of time in the project?\r\n\r\n\u2022 Continuity is the most important thing for me in editing. I also hope to add some movement to the video through jump cuts. I put relatively static clips together, and put relatively large movements in the second half, and return to the quiet scene at the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to\r\ndepict in your portrait?\r\n\r\n\u2022 In my videos, I mainly depict my daily life, playing Go, cooking, and making mate tea. In the past, I wrote my name in a notebook and wrote my future expectations at the end. In terms of personality, I used the range of my movements to describe myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your\r\nwork?\r\n\r\n\u2022 Talking about the expression method, this really bothered me for a long time. I thought of many ways, such as expressing it in the third person, using my own shadow to express it, or even putting a paper bag on my head to express it. There are many more haha, but in the end I chose to focus on my own hands because we use our hands to do many things every day, just like typing my hands now, eating, making tea, and everything else. I watched some movies and drew how they depicted the feeling of hands. Unfortunately, because I was the only photographer, the effect was average. But I still like this concept very much. I think it can be used. Hands are a perfect representation of oneself.\r\n\r\nAssignment 2 - Graphic Icons\r\n\u2022 How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose\r\nthe theme that you did?\n\n\u2022 The idea behind this set of icons I made was that I was trying to make an icon for a social application. The theme was system. I gave these icons a basic function and meaning, such as albums and contacts. I think the final effect is not bad. The reason why I chose this theme was actually mainly because of an article I read before about why there is no social application with all functions in Europe and the United States, like Instagram plus PayPal plus Twitter, so I wanted to try to make one.\n\n\r\n\u2022 Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed\r\nacross those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?\n\n\u2022 Yes, I have thought about making another theme icon before, similar to the game, but there are many points in it that are difficult for me to present now, and I am not proficient in the software, so I changed another method to draw the icon.\n\n\r\n\u2022 How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator?\r\nWas anything lost in that translation, or gained?\n\n\u2022 I started by looking at some designs by other people and some company proposals, blended them together, and drew sketches based on my own understanding. Then I tried different effects in illustrator and finally turned them into a set of icons without losing too much detail compared to the initial sketches.\n\n\r\n\u2022 How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why\r\ndid you choose the palette that you did?\n\n\u2022 I used non-obtrusive colors, such as blue and green for functionality, red for prompts, and gray for systems. In addition, I referred to the products of mature commercial companies. Then I considered how to distribute the colors reasonably, and finally they became the colors of my icons.\n\n\r\n\u2022 How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design\r\ncorrespond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?\n\n\u2022 The process is actually quite similar to the video. Sound gives people a feeling. It is a way to provide emotional power and texture. So I hope to add some sounds that are not abrupt to give people a sense of texture and reality. Just like I added the sound of turning pages to the collection function, which is very common but rarely heard. At the same time, I also used some electronic sounds to simulate our daily reminders.\n\n\r\n\u2022 How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of\r\nconcrete visual designs?\n\n\u2022 First, I need to thoroughly understand what this abstract idea means. Then I research related topics to find inspiration. This may include looking at similar designs, artwork, colors, shapes, and styles. Then I brainstorm to turn the abstract ideas into specific keywords or concepts. I draw preliminary sketches to turn the ideas into visual forms. At the same time, I think about how to convey emotions and information through these elements. Finally, I use software to create prototypes.\r\n\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1728126768, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "createdDate": "2024-10-05", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P23": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/Homework Tasks - Week 10, Session 2.html", "labels": ["blog"], "postTitle": "Homework Tasks - Week 10, Session 2", "postUrl": "post/Homework%20Tasks%20-%20Week%2010%2C%20Session%202.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/yichiban1/yichiban.github.io/issues/23", "commentNum": 0, "description": "", "wordCount": 0, "top": 0, "createdAt": 1728460621, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "createdDate": "2024-10-09", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P25": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/Homework Tasks - Week 11\uff0cSession 2.html", "labels": ["blog"], "postTitle": "Homework Tasks - Week 11\uff0cSession 2", "postUrl": "post/Homework%20Tasks%20-%20Week%2011%EF%BC%8CSession%202.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/yichiban1/yichiban.github.io/issues/25", "commentNum": 0, "description": "", "wordCount": 0, "top": 0, "createdAt": 1728906788, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "createdDate": "2024-10-14", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}}, "singeListJson": {}, "labelColorDict": {"blog": "#0052cc", "bug": "#d73a4a", "documentation": "#0075ca", "duplicate": "#cfd3d7", "enhancement": "#a2eeef", "good first issue": "#7057ff", "help wanted": "#008672", "invalid": "#e4e669", "question": "#d876e3", "wontfix": "#ffffff"}, "displayTitle": "Yichiban's Go", "faviconUrl": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "primerCSS": "<link href='https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/cdnjs/ajax/libs/Primer/21.0.7/primer.css' rel='stylesheet' />", "homeUrl": "https://yichiban1.github.io/yichiban.github.io", "prevUrl": "/index.html", "nextUrl": "disabled"}
