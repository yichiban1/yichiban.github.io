I took the video of the scenery on the tram. I used to live in the suburbs, so I was far away from the school. So I didn't know what to take a video of, so I took a video of the scenery outside the tram windows.\n\nDoria took a video of the state library and Julie took a video of her desk at home.\n\nSome brief reflections on that process\n\nI think the videos I shoot are boring, only the scenery. Maybe I need something more interesting.
