For example, the pen in my hand when the pen fall the light turns green.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7919596-aa6e-4d4a-90ba-448f4bfaa5b4)\n\nWhen the green light comes out, I write something in my notebook and then connect with some conceptual stuff.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b6cd667-aa65-4242-8763-85a2074fd722)\n\nThe third picture I wanted to express a sense of discontinuity, similar to a jump cut, but the final result might not be very good.

I also occasionally go out for a walk. I hope to show a calm emotion, so the movements are usually fixed or the movements are relatively small.\n\nQuestion:The editing method influences the main themes, concepts, actions and feelings I want to present to the viewer ?\n\nAnswer: I want to give people a sense of calmness, so the movements are not big during the shooting. But in the middle part, I want to show the dynamics, so I want to create a sense of discontinuity. At other times, I basically hope that the video editing is logical, that is, to maintain coherence. There are also some conceptual things, such as green plants and sunshine. I hope there is a meaning in them, perhaps growth or simply to tell the viewer that it is dawn.\n\n(Sorry, professor, if you see this, I need to say sorry because my storyboard is really bad I'm not used to drawing on the computer.)\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1723370171, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "createdDate": "2024-08-11", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P8": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/Homework Tasks - Week 2, Session 2.html", "labels": ["blog"], "postTitle": "Homework Tasks - Week 2, Session 2", "postUrl": "post/Homework%20Tasks%20-%20Week%202%2C%20Session%202.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/yichiban1/yichiban.github.io/issues/8", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 2265, "description": "Question: Key moments in the two-minute video ?\n\nAnswer: As the creator of this video, I like the beginning and the end of this video.

I used ambient sounds and slow guitars to create a balance between the audio and visual elements. The sound of water, wind, and the sound of a book closing are all elements.\n\nQuestion: Emotional tone How editing will support that tone?\n\nAnswer: The coherent editing and emotional tone are what I want to present. I hope that people who watch my video will at least feel relaxed when watching my video, so I don\u2019t want the ending to be illogical, so I hope that there won\u2019t be any particularly fast-cut editing at the end.\n\nQuestion: The relationship between the shots I want to establish?\n\nAnswer: For me, the relationship between shots is important. If the continuity of the shots is disrupted, the video will feel weird. So I hope that each shot or the next shot is logical and does not make people feel out of place.\n\nQuestion: Trying to establish the rhythm beat speed editing how to produce this effect?\n\nAnswer: At the end, I hope to make a fade-out with the I close the book, and there is also the sound of running water.

This is actually more difficult than I thought. How to express the natural movements of the hands and how to express the changes of light and shadow on the hands?\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6fd8b10-b95c-4e94-ad32-05e095ffb566)\n\nOf course, it is best to present it naturally, but I have to put the phone in a stable position to shoot. I actually have a lot of things I want to present, but it is difficult for me to do it at this stage. Just like the directors in the movies, they can shoot the hands like ballet dancers, so the movement of the hands is a problem for me.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff0f7e2c-b0a0-4094-b519-cfa59349af39)\n\nThe topic of hands is also very interesting to me because I remember that AI-made paintings and videos often make mistakes on hands. Michelangelo's oil painting Creation of Eve, Adam's outstretched fingers represent what it means to me is a beginning and a connection, so I hope that my hands in the video can also have a meaning, just like a fist \ud83d\udc4a can represent courage and anger, the hands I present in the video are more like representing myself, my emotions, and my feelings.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef77b095-c11e-46da-9b2f-4cdced69020c)\n\nAnd this is D\u00fcrer's Praying Hands \ud83d\ude4f A very important painting in art history. When I was writing this article \u270d\ufe0f, I suddenly thought of this painting. I guess this painting can better represent my thoughts.\n\n\uff08Professor, if you can see this, I would really appreciate it\ud83d\ude4f I wrote too much and my writing is not good.

The PlayStation system icon has simple lines that can tell the user what the icon is used for. I also thought of an icon for the weather app, but there are only a few types of weather, such as sunny, rainy, snowy, cloudy, etc. The other one is a game icon. I actually like this idea very much. I even drew a rough sketch. But recently I tried it and found that it is too difficult for me to challenge the game icon at my current level.\n\nSo recently I thought of social networking apps. Actually I think this is not bad. We use it almost every day. Think about the billions of people who use social networking apps in the world. What a huge user group. As for why I chose this theme, system, I think we use these apps every day, but when we are used to using it, we will forget about these icons and just rely on our subconscious to react to them. So I think you must be an excellent designer\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfa8to be able to make this feeling. Different functions in the app can become icons, so I want to design icons for it. The specific platform is the mobile phone. The background is some basic functions. The audience on the social networking app I hope is everyone, regardless of gender, age or young, but I hope the icon design is a little more interesting, so it may also be more inclined to a slightly younger group.\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1724064840, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "createdDate": "2024-08-19", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P12": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/Homework Tasks - Week4, Session 2.html", "labels": ["blog"], "postTitle": "Homework Tasks - Week4, Session 2", "postUrl": "post/Homework%20Tasks%20-%20Week4%2C%20Session%202.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/yichiban1/yichiban.github.io/issues/12", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 3647, "description": "Thumbnail Sketching Activity\r\nThis is the yerba mate\ud83e\uddc9cup I drew\r\n\r\nI like the second bird's-eye view. You can see the tea straws in the cup like pillars falling from the sky. It's very simple and the effect looks ok.\r\n\r\n ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6f5d8bf-ac08-4edf-a588-0d71e9e636a1)\r\n\r\nSketch of the icon created for assignment 2\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c1bf3aa-f058-40ea-a100-6fa6bd447ba7)\r\n\r\nFor the castle I might do a third one Because I want it to be simple but still symbolic. Regarding the mask\ud83d\udc7a, I wanted to make it the first one because I wanted it to provide unity. If I chose something else, it would look weird in a series of icons.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/722748e4-695d-4f74-8b3b-8186c51e3479)\r\n\r\nRegarding the wind, I think it is really difficult to depict the agility of the wind with lines, so I might end up making something like a cloud to set off the feeling of the \ud83c\udf2c\ufe0fwind.\r\n\r\nRegarding throwing, I thought of some shurikens and kunai, but in the end I still wanted to use an abstract pattern to represent them, so in the end I might choose something like Hot Wheels. I think this should be a good example to use vertical line because it can show aggressive\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52d3146b-a1f9-48c4-84b2-b0de7f171f76)\r\n\r\nI think both shrines\u26e9\ufe0fand\ud83c\udfefJapanese castles (similar to temples) are good icons to respond to the theme of tranquility. So in the end, my choice of icon might be the one in the middle, which is neither ostentatious nor symbolic. In terms of architecture, I think I will probably use horizontal lines because architecture\ud83c\udfd7\ufe0fneeds to give people a sense of stability.\r\n\r\nFoxes\ud83e\udd8aare actually quite interesting animals in the game. In my hometown, people believe that foxes are a kind of natural spirituality that is difficult to express in words. Therefore, the appearance of foxes in the game with the same oriental background can also make a calm response. So I might choose the first or the second one. Sorry, \ud83d\ude35I have difficulty making choices.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/637022f3-8c1c-4910-bff3-77acbc248234)\r\n\r\nSwords are always a topic that cannot be avoided in games. I hope to reflect the texture and the feeling of movement. I should choose the first one.\r\n\r\nRegarding amulets, this is a very interesting topic\ud83e\uddff. I drew Chinese knots \ud83e\udea2and Japanese blessing tokens, but the game background takes place in Japan, so wooden tokens should be my choice. I also hope to show the texture.\r\n\r\nIt is quite interesting to talk about yurts, because my hometown actually includes the eastern part of Inner Mongolia\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddf3, so I actually have some understanding of yurts. For the Mongolians, a nomadic people, using RVs \ud83d\ude90as a metaphor is more appropriate from today's perspective. During the most glorious period of the Mongol Empire, yurts could be quickly moved away and rebuilt when they were sent to other places for battle\u2694\ufe0f. So this can be said to be a symbol of the Mongolian people. On the grasslands, soldiers would drink and eat meat in yurts when it was cold. So for a game that tells the story of the Yuan-Japan War, I think yurts\ud83d\uded6 are a very good choice. I think I will choose the one in the middle. It is a building, but it does not have the rigidity of traditional buildings. It is more like a home that flutters slightly in the wind on the grassland\ud83c\udfd5\ufe0f.\r\nI hope to express the weight and character of Mongolians\ud83c\udf7e\ud83c\udfc7\ud83d\udd7a\ud83c\udffb, which is rough but also makes them look like exquisite handicrafts\ud83e\uddf5. If possible, I hope I can draw \ud83c\udfa8some patterns on the final yurt icon.\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1724317612, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "createdDate": "2024-08-22", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}}, "singeListJson": {}, "labelColorDict": {"blog": "#0052cc", "bug": "#d73a4a", "documentation": "#0075ca", "duplicate": "#cfd3d7", "enhancement": "#a2eeef", "good first issue": "#7057ff", "help wanted": "#008672", "invalid": "#e4e669", "question": "#d876e3", "wontfix": "#ffffff"}, "displayTitle": "Yichiban's Go", "faviconUrl": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160466378?v=4", "primerCSS": "<link href='https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/cdnjs/ajax/libs/Primer/21.0.7/primer.css' rel='stylesheet' />", "homeUrl": "https://yichiban1.github.io/yichiban.github.io", "prevUrl": "disabled", "nextUrl": "disabled"}
