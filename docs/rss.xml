The first shot is from the shoes in the crowd, switching to my shoes, In my opinion, this is a kind of continuity. For example, the pen in my hand when the pen fall the light turns green.

When the green light comes out, I write something in my notebook and then connect with some conceptual stuff.

The third picture I wanted to express a sense of discontinuity, similar to a jump cut, but the final result might not be very good. The content is mainly about me going out.

The fourth photo shows my hobbies: playing chess, cooking, and drinking mate. I also occasionally go out for a walk. I hope to show a calm emotion, so the movements are usually fixed or the movements are relatively small.

Question:The editing method influences the main themes, concepts, actions and feelings I want to present to the viewer ?

Answer: I want to give people a sense of calmness, so the movements are not big during the shooting. But in the middle part, I want to show the dynamics, so I want to create a sense of discontinuity. At other times, I basically hope that the video editing is logical, that is, to maintain coherence. There are also some conceptual things, such as green plants and sunshine. I hope there is a meaning in them, perhaps growth or simply to tell the viewer that it is dawn.

(Sorry, professor, if you see this, I need to say sorry because my storyboard is really bad I'm not used to drawing on the computer.)。</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://yichiban1.github.io/yichiban.github.io/post/Homework%20Tasks%20-Week%202%2C%20Session%201.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 09:56:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Homework Tasks - Week1, Session 2</title><link>https://yichiban1.github.io/yichiban.github.io/post/Homework%20Tasks%20-%20Week1%2C%20Session%202.html</link><description>https://youtu.be/7ynDcNB4T9g?si=CB2Z5z2P4Ad-q1JM

How successful I feel 

I think the success rate is about 30%. I took the video of the scenery on the tram. I used to live in the suburbs, so I was far away from the school. So I didn't know what to take a video of, so I took a video of the scenery outside the tram windows.

Doria took a video of the state library and Julie took a video of her desk at home.

Some brief reflections on that process

I think the videos I shoot are boring, only the scenery. Maybe I need something more interesting. This requires me to learn editing skills like other video bloggers.

Aiming for

I hope that one day I can learn more practical skills so that one day I can watch more of my own videos at least I won’t be bored. But I’m lazy so I hope I can do it one day.。</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://yichiban1.github.io/yichiban.github.io/post/Homework%20Tasks%20-%20Week1%2C%20Session%202.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 04:55:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>SCAVERGER HUNT 25/JULY</title><link>https://yichiban1.github.io/yichiban.github.io/post/SCAVERGER%20HUNT%2025-JULY.html</link><description>On Monday, Julie, Fiona and I went scavenger hunting in the school with clues and maps. It was not easy becasue there were many things I couldn’t understand, and things I could’t find.
