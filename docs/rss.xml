The process of making a draft

I thought of many ideas, such as using the changes in the shadow üë• under the light to introduce myself, treating the doll üß∏ as myself and only shooting the doll, and only shooting the back of my head in the video, but to be honest, these are a bit difficult for me to shoot alone because I am alone.

Finally, I chose to shoot my hands and feet to express the changes and movements of the hands in different scenes. This is actually more difficult than I thought. How to express the natural movements of the hands and how to express the changes of light and shadow on the hands?

Of course, it is best to present it naturally, but I have to put the phone in a stable position to shoot. I actually have a lot of things I want to present, but it is difficult for me to do it at this stage. Just like the directors in the movies, they can shoot the hands like ballet dancers, so the movement of the hands is a problem for me.

The topic of hands is also very interesting to me because I remember that AI-made paintings and videos often make mistakes on hands. Michelangelo's oil painting Creation of Eve, Adam's outstretched fingers represent what it means to me is a beginning and a connection, so I hope that my hands in the video can also have a meaning, just like a fist üëä can represent courage and anger, the hands I present in the video are more like representing myself, my emotions, and my feelings.

And this is D√ºrer's Praying Hands üôè A very important painting in art history. When I was writing this article ‚úçÔ∏è, I suddenly thought of this painting. I guess this painting can better represent my thoughts.

ÔºàProfessor, if you can see this, I would really appreciate itüôè I wrote too much and my writing is not good. Only text looks too boring, so I added some emojis.

Answer: As the creator of this video, I like the beginning and the end of this video. If I have to choose, I would choose the end because if possible, I hope that the viewers will think that this is an interesting idea when they see the end.

Question: How I planing to use Sound design and soundtrack to construct this moment ?

Answer: At the end I took videos of the lake, the temple, the flowing water and finally I wrote down my expectations for the future.

So these are all calm shots. I used ambient sounds and slow guitars to create a balance between the audio and visual elements. The sound of water, wind, and the sound of a book closing are all elements.

Question: Emotional tone How editing will support that tone?

Answer: The coherent editing and emotional tone are what I want to present. I hope that people who watch my video will at least feel relaxed when watching my video, so I don‚Äôt want the ending to be illogical, so I hope that there won‚Äôt be any particularly fast-cut editing at the end.

Question: The relationship between the shots I want to establish?

Answer: For me, the relationship between shots is important. If the continuity of the shots is disrupted, the video will feel weird. So I hope that each shot or the next shot is logical and does not make people feel out of place.

Question: Trying to establish the rhythm beat speed editing how to produce this effect?

Answer: At the end, I hope to make a fade-out with the I close the book, and there is also the sound of running water. I want to make a G cut. I hope the ambient sound can give people a feeling of comfort and texture.

The first shot of the hand lying on the bench by the sea with ambient sound and background music.

The second shot is the sound of returning home and throwing keys on the table.

The third shot is the sound of brewing yerba mate tea and background music.

The fourth shot Go game ambient sound and fade-in.

The fifth shot is the sound of cooking and background music.

The sixth one I put my hands together üôè There is no ambient sound because it is too noisy outside, so there is only background music.„ÄÇ</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://yichiban1.github.io/yichiban.github.io/post/Homework%20Tasks%20-%20Week2%2C%20Session%202.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 10:55:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Homework Tasks -Week 2, Session 1</title><link>https://yichiban1.github.io/yichiban.github.io/post/Homework%20Tasks%20-Week%202%2C%20Session%201.html</link><description>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/201a6e0e-e47f-4325-9513-2097feb6c519)

The first shot is from the shoes in the crowd, switching to my shoes, In my opinion, this is a kind of continuity. For example, the pen in my hand when the pen fall the light turns green.

When the green light comes out, I write something in my notebook and then connect with some conceptual stuff.

The third picture I wanted to express a sense of discontinuity, similar to a jump cut, but the final result might not be very good. The content is mainly about me going out.

The fourth photo shows my hobbies: playing chess, cooking, and drinking mate. I also occasionally go out for a walk. I hope to show a calm emotion, so the movements are usually fixed or the movements are relatively small.

Question:The editing method influences the main themes, concepts, actions and feelings I want to present to the viewer ?

Answer: I want to give people a sense of calmness, so the movements are not big during the shooting. But in the middle part, I want to show the dynamics, so I want to create a sense of discontinuity. At other times, I basically hope that the video editing is logical, that is, to maintain coherence. There are also some conceptual things, such as green plants and sunshine. I hope there is a meaning in them, perhaps growth or simply to tell the viewer that it is dawn.

(Sorry, professor, if you see this, I need to say sorry because my storyboard is really bad I'm not used to drawing on the computer.)„ÄÇ</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://yichiban1.github.io/yichiban.github.io/post/Homework%20Tasks%20-Week%202%2C%20Session%201.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 09:56:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Homework Tasks - Week1, Session 2</title><link>https://yichiban1.github.io/yichiban.github.io/post/Homework%20Tasks%20-%20Week1%2C%20Session%202.html</link><description>https://youtu.be/7ynDcNB4T9g?si=CB2Z5z2P4Ad-q1JM

How successful I feel 

I think the success rate is about 30%. I took the video of the scenery on the tram. I used to live in the suburbs, so I was far away from the school. So I didn't know what to take a video of, so I took a video of the scenery outside the tram windows.

Doria took a video of the state library and Julie took a video of her desk at home.

Some brief reflections on that process

I think the videos I shoot are boring, only the scenery. Maybe I need something more interesting. This requires me to learn editing skills like other video bloggers.

Aiming for

I hope that one day I can learn more practical skills so that one day I can watch more of my own videos at least I won‚Äôt be bored. But I‚Äôm lazy so I hope I can do it one day.„ÄÇ</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://yichiban1.github.io/yichiban.github.io/post/Homework%20Tasks%20-%20Week1%2C%20Session%202.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 04:55:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>SCAVERGER HUNT 25/JULY</title><link>https://yichiban1.github.io/yichiban.github.io/post/SCAVERGER%20HUNT%2025-JULY.html</link><description>On Monday, Julie, Fiona and I went scavenger hunting in the school with clues and maps.
