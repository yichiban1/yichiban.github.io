How successful I feel 

I think the success rate is about 30%. I took the video of the scenery on the tram. I used to live in the suburbs, so I was far away from the school. So I didn't know what to take a video of, so I took a video of the scenery outside the tram windows.

Doria took a video of the state library and Julie took a video of her desk at home.

Some brief reflections on that process

I think the videos I shoot are boring, only the scenery. Maybe I need something more interesting. This requires me to learn editing skills like other video bloggers.

Aiming for

I hope that one day I can learn more practical skills so that one day I can watch more of my own videos at least I won’t be bored. But I’m lazy so I hope I can do it one day.。</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://yichiban1.github.io/yichiban.github.io/post/Homework%20Tasks%20-%20Week1%2C%20Session%202.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 04:55:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>SCAVERGER HUNT 25/JULY</title><link>https://yichiban1.github.io/yichiban.github.io/post/SCAVERGER%20HUNT%2025-JULY.html</link><description>On Monday, Julie, Fiona and I went scavenger hunting in the school with clues and maps. It was not easy becasue there were many things I couldn’t understand, and things I could’t find.
