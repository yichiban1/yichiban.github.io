Assignment 1 - Video Edit
• How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of
your edit?

• In videos, sound is used to provide emotions and make the audience feel present, such as the texture of some objects matching a video clip, such as what the sound of keys dropped on a table should be, and some L cuts and J cuts. When the video switches to a new scene, the audience already has an expectation of what is about to appear through the audio. J cuts help create a sense of anticipation and smoothly guide the audience from one scene to another. They are often used to introduce new characters or scenes. L cuts help maintain continuity between scenes and make transitions more natural. They are often used to keep the dialogue flowing or show what is mentioned in the dialogue.

• How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?

• How to use video to create a self-portrait was a big problem for me at that time because I was no different from others, maybe there were some minor differences, so it was hard for me to figure out how to present my own uniqueness. I shot about 60 clips at that time. I really went to many places in those three weeks because I really didn’t know what to shoot, so I went out to look for it. My video clips might be when I was walking on the street and suddenly I thought of an idea and shot it. All my materials were shot in Melbourne. I think it was more like an adventure because I had just arrived here.

• What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how
did you apply this knowledge to your project?

• Sound is an important factor in the video. I hope it is non-narrative but also can provide strength to the video. In my video, I use L cut and J cut as well as some daily sounds such as washing hands, washing dishes and opening doors to enhance the texture of life.


• How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use
these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?

• Continuity is the most important thing for me in editing. I also hope to add some movement to the video through jump cuts. I put relatively static clips together, and put relatively large movements in the second half, and return to the quiet scene at the end.


• Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to
depict in your portrait?

• In my videos, I mainly depict my daily life, playing Go, cooking, and making mate tea. In the past, I wrote my name in a notebook and wrote my future expectations at the end. In terms of personality, I used the range of my movements to describe myself.


• What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your
work?

• Talking about the expression method, this really bothered me for a long time. I thought of many ways, such as expressing it in the third person, using my own shadow to express it, or even putting a paper bag on my head to express it. There are many more haha, but in the end I chose to focus on my own hands because we use our hands to do many things every day, just like typing my hands now, eating, making tea, and everything else. I watched some movies and drew how they depicted the feeling of hands. Unfortunately, because I was the only photographer, the effect was average. But I still like this concept very much. I think it can be used. Hands are a perfect representation of oneself.

Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons
• How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose
the theme that you did?

• The idea behind this set of icons I made was that I was trying to make an icon for a social application. The theme was system. I gave these icons a basic function and meaning, such as albums and contacts. I think the final effect is not bad. The reason why I chose this theme was actually mainly because of an article I read before about why there is no social application with all functions in Europe and the United States, like Instagram plus PayPal plus Twitter, so I wanted to try to make one.


• Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed
across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?

• Yes, I have thought about making another theme icon before, similar to the game, but there are many points in it that are difficult for me to present now, and I am not proficient in the software, so I changed another method to draw the icon.


• How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator?
Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?

• I started by looking at some designs by other people and some company proposals, blended them together, and drew sketches based on my own understanding. Then I tried different effects in illustrator and finally turned them into a set of icons without losing too much detail compared to the initial sketches.


• How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why
did you choose the palette that you did?

• I used non-obtrusive colors, such as blue and green for functionality, red for prompts, and gray for systems. In addition, I referred to the products of mature commercial companies. Then I considered how to distribute the colors reasonably, and finally they became the colors of my icons.


• How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design
correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?

• The process is actually quite similar to the video. Sound gives people a feeling. It is a way to provide emotional power and texture. So I hope to add some sounds that are not abrupt to give people a sense of texture and reality. Just like I added the sound of turning pages to the collection function, which is very common but rarely heard. At the same time, I also used some electronic sounds to simulate our daily reminders.


• How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of
concrete visual designs?

• First, I need to thoroughly understand what this abstract idea means. Then I research related topics to find inspiration. This may include looking at similar designs, artwork, colors, shapes, and styles. Then I brainstorm to turn the abstract ideas into specific keywords or concepts. I draw preliminary sketches to turn the ideas into visual forms. At the same time, I think about how to convey emotions and information through these elements. Finally, I use software to create prototypes.

Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment
• How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that
process?

• I drew a sketch to provide an idea of ​​the entire 3D environment. The final effect was similar to it. I thought about what kind of path, what kind of guidance, and what kind of subject should be presented. The sketch recorded my responses to these questions.


• How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment
differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional
media?

• I think there is a big difference between 3D and 2D objects. When I was working with 2D objects, which were icons, I tended to think like a designer, whereas in 3D we think more like architects, thinking about the spatial boundaries of objects and their placement.


• What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and
different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?

• The camera I chose for my project was actually the third person because the first person perspective was too short and there was no way to get a bird's eye view of the environment. That's why I used the third person perspective. In assignment 1 and assignment 3, the camera's role is to provide the audience with emotions. In assignment 1, it is more about expressing one's own interpretation, while in assignment 3, it is more like simulating the changes brought about by the environment.


• How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your
use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?

• There are similarities and differences. I still try to give the player a sense of reality, like the sound of running water, but the difference is the feeling of 3D audio. I use strings to bring a changing atmosphere to the environment, and the sound of each door is different, deepening the feeling of change.


• How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme
or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?

• In a virtual environment, consistency is an important principle to maintain user navigation and understanding. In the field of design, visual consistency is to maintain a unified pace as a whole, including color, layout, elements, etc. Naturalness is to simulate the real world as much as possible. For example, the presentation of visual elements such as lighting, shadows, and materials, as well as the application of sensory stimulation such as sound and touch, can enhance the user's sense of immersion.


• What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have
discovered otherwise?

• During the game testing process, I found the following 
game bugs: such as character stuck, sudden game crash, etc. Operational issues: whether the game control is smooth and whether it is easy for players to get started. 
User experience: whether the game interface is friendly and whether it is easy for players to understand the game rules.

User experience: whether the game interface is friendly and whether it is easy for players to understand the game rules.</p></div>
