Unfortunately, my writing is very poor. This may be something I am not good at when it comes to academic writing. But I have a plan for how to write an artist statement. Here are some of the points I have summarized.

1. Personal Background:
• Briefly describe my upbringing, education, and artistic journey.
• Describe what sparked my interest and love for art.

2. Artistic Style and Influences:
• Describe how my artistic style was developed and which artists, movements, or cultures have influenced you.
• Discuss common themes and elements in my art.

3. Creative Process:
• Share my creative process, including sources of inspiration, conception, sketching, production and completion of the work.
• Discuss the main challenges I encountered in my creation and how I overcame them.

4. Artistic Philosophy and Purpose:
• State my artistic philosophy, i.e. what message or emotion I hope to convey through my art.
• Describe the purpose or goal I want to achieve with my artwork.

5. Interpretation of the Work:
• Provide a personal interpretation of my work, including how I would like the viewer to understand and feel your work.
• Discuss the possible place of my work in society, culture, or art history.

6. Personal Experience and Artistic Creation:
• Share how personal experiences have influenced my art.
• Describe how my personal life and my art are intertwined.

7. Personal Experience:
• Share my emotional experience of art creation, including satisfaction, frustration, or any other emotions.

__However, there is no fixed format for an artist's statement. For me, it should be sincere and personalized.__

So I don’t want to write an artist statement that is too long and makes people feel irritated and boring. I have been to art galleries many times. If I have to mention a famous artist whose works I have visited, it should be Morandi. Why him? Maybe it’s because my art teacher always mentioned him and talked about “high-grade gray”, so I have a very deep impression of him.

It has to be said that his works really make people feel the meaning of 'high-grade gray'. At the same time, his characteristics

I have been searching for his work in my photo album for a long time. This was taken three and a half years ago. I think it is quite good.

Actually, this is an example. Morandi is a master. Although I am a student, there are 8 billion people in the world. Everyone has their own ideas and different points. So I think we can also write our own unique artist statement by learning and summarizing.
