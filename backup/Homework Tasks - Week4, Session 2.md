This is the yerba mate🧉cup I drew

I like the second bird's-eye view. You can see the tea straws in the cup like pillars falling from the sky. It's very simple and the effect looks ok.

For the castle I might do a third one Because I want it to be simple but still symbolic. Regarding the mask👺, I wanted to make it the first one because I wanted it to provide unity. If I chose something else, it would look weird in a series of icons.

Regarding the wind, I think it is really difficult to depict the agility of the wind with lines, so I might end up making something like a cloud to set off the feeling of the 🌬️wind.

Regarding throwing, I thought of some shurikens and kunai, but in the end I still wanted to use an abstract pattern to represent them, so in the end I might choose something like Hot Wheels. I think this should be a good example to use vertical line because it can show aggressive

I think both shrines⛩️and🏯Japanese castles (similar to temples) are good icons to respond to the theme of tranquility. So in the end, my choice of icon might be the one in the middle, which is neither ostentatious nor symbolic. In terms of architecture, I think I will probably use horizontal lines because architecture🏗️needs to give people a sense of stability.

Foxes🦊are actually quite interesting animals in the game. In my hometown, people believe that foxes are a kind of natural spirituality that is difficult to express in words. Therefore, the appearance of foxes in the game with the same oriental background can also make a calm response. So I might choose the first or the second one. Sorry, 😵I have difficulty making choices.

Swords are always a topic that cannot be avoided in games. I hope to reflect the texture and the feeling of movement. I should choose the first one.
