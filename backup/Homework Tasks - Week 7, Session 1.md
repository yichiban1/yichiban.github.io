Assignment 3 feels a bit difficult since this is the first time to do something in a 3D environment.

This is the class activity first try, hope I can do better in the future

__About personal transformation

I think this is the hardest part because it is always hard for me to choose The transformation and the environment, how to blend them together to make a good concept is definitely the most difficult thing to express in the third stage.

Think of three transformations in class: big, medium and small

I think the biggest one is the two years I spent in Italy. I basically spent 17 to 18 years there. I went through a lot of changes in those two years. I first lived in a small Italian town with a population of only 20,000 people for a year.

Small transformation I think it was the movie Chungking Express and some black and white movies. Since then, I have become interested in the filming techniques and stories of movies.

I haven't figured out the medium transformation yet.

I hope the material can give a certain sense of reality and let people feel the texture.

I hope to use the sounds that we are familiar with in our daily lives, such as the sound of wind and grass, to give people a sense of harmony.

I also made a small sketch for this map of mine
