****Discussing accessible web design****

I certainly want my web pages to be accessible and this depends on a variety of elements: text, fonts, colors, contrast, typography, layout, etc.

__And here is what I did in the final web version__

Text
• Readability: Choose a clear and readable font, and the font size should be suitable for screen reading.
• Line height: Appropriate line height can improve the readability of text, and at least 1.5 times the font size is usually recommended on the Internet.
• Spacing: Appropriate spacing between paragraphs and around text can improve reading comfort.

Fonts
• Font selection: Choose screen-friendly fonts and avoid overly decorative fonts, especially in body text.
• Font size: Make sure the font size is adjustable to accommodate different versions of mobile phones or computers.

Color
• Contrast: Ensure that there is enough contrast between the text and the background, in compliance with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.
• Aesthetics of color: Try not to use overly complex colors. There shouldn’t be 5 or 6 colors in the background of a picture. Keeping it simple is not a bad thing.

Contrast
• Visual hierarchy: Use contrast to create visual hierarchy and highlight important content.
• Icons and buttons: Make sure icons and buttons have enough contrast with the background so that users can easily recognize them.

Format and Layout
• Consistency: Maintain a consistent typographic style throughout your site, including fonts, colors, and layout.
• Alignment: Alignment of text and elements can enhance the cleanliness and professionalism of your page.
• Emphasis: Use bold, italics, or underlining to emphasize certain parts of your text, but don’t overdo it.

When it comes to grid layout

I initially thought it was useless and even thought that the software already had some built-in distance measurement tools so there was no need for a layout grid, but then I realized its importance

Grid layout can help us do these things

Structured: Grids provide a clear framework that helps organize content and elements.

Consistency: Grids ensure that design elements are aligned and spaced consistently across pages and devices.

Flexibility: Grid systems give designers the flexibility to position and adjust elements while maintaining overall consistency.

Visual balance: Grids help achieve visual balance and prevent the page from looking too crowded or too empty.

The above is all theory. How to use grid-based layout to improve web design

• Define the grid: Decide on the number of columns and gutters in the grid, and how they adapt to different screen sizes.

• Content first: Allocate grid space based on the importance and function of the content.

• Hierarchy: Use the grid to create a visual hierarchy and direct the user's attention to the most important elements. 

• Flexibility: While modular and formulaic, you can also break the grid rules. Sometimes, some creative adjustments are needed for the overall effect of the design.
