How successful I feel 

I think the success rate is about 30%. I took the video of the scenery on the tram. I used to live in the suburbs, so I was far away from the school. So I didn't know what to take a video of, so I took a video of the scenery outside the tram windows.

Doria took a video of the state library and Julie took a video of her desk at home.

Some brief reflections on that process

I think the videos I shoot are boring, only the scenery. Maybe I need something more interesting. This requires me to learn editing skills like other video bloggers.

Aiming for

I hope that one day I can learn more practical skills so that one day I can watch more of my own videos at least I won’t be bored. But I’m lazy so I hope I can do it one day.
