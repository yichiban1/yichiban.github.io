About the design process and design decisions

My first step is to analyze the needs Thinking about what basic and additional features the user groups and audiences need and how to present them is likeðŸ¤”thinking about the visual preferences of most people.

After that, it was concept development. Based on the needs analysis, after thinking about the overall style of the icons, I decided to adopt a simple and modern design to ensure that the icons are clearly identifiable under different backgrounds and conform to the overall aesthetic of the system application theme. There is also a basic color scheme. I decided to use gradient colors and soft color schemes to create a sense of depth visually while avoiding too strong color contrast to ensure that the entire set of icons can be harmoniously integrated into the interface.

ï¼ˆJust like this feeling, I also searched a lot on the Internetï¼‰

After that comes the preliminary design, which I sketch in my notebook to make sure the icons are visually consistent and convey their respective functions.

Then the detailed design is to further refine the details of the icon. The gradient shadow and semi-transparent effect are used to make the icon still have a three-dimensional feeling in the case of flat style, and it can also be differentiated from other similar social networking icons.

Finally, there is the final confirmation test and optimization. At that time, I will review my own icon and think about what to do for the icon at this time. Should I adjust the thickness of the line or reduce useless details? I will try to adjust it when the time comes.
