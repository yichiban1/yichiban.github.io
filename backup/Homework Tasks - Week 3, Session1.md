The process of making a draft

I thought of many ideas, such as using the changes in the shadow 👥 under the light to introduce myself, treating the doll 🧸 as myself and only shooting the doll, and only shooting the back of my head in the video, but to be honest, these are a bit difficult for me to shoot alone because I am alone.

Finally, I chose to shoot my hands and feet to express the changes and movements of the hands in different scenes. This is actually more difficult than I thought. How to express the natural movements of the hands and how to express the changes of light and shadow on the hands?

Of course, it is best to present it naturally, but I have to put the phone in a stable position to shoot. I actually have a lot of things I want to present, but it is difficult for me to do it at this stage. Just like the directors in the movies, they can shoot the hands like ballet dancers, so the movement of the hands is a problem for me.

The topic of hands is also very interesting to me because I remember that AI-made paintings and videos often make mistakes on hands. Michelangelo's oil painting Creation of Eve, Adam's outstretched fingers represent what it means to me is a beginning and a connection, so I hope that my hands in the video can also have a meaning, just like a fist 👊 can represent courage and anger, the hands I present in the video are more like representing myself, my emotions, and my feelings.

And this is Dürer's Praying Hands 🙏 A very important painting in art history. When I was writing this article ✍️, I suddenly thought of this painting. I guess this painting can better represent my thoughts.

（Professor, if you can see this, I would really appreciate it🙏 I wrote too much and my writing is not good. Only text looks too boring, so I added some emojis. Thank You Again for your patience.）
