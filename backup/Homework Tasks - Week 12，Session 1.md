__Let me talk about my entire web design process__

I don't want my webpage to be static and just sit there quietly like a book on a shelf. I want it to be dynamic and alive, and to convey my emotions, feelings and thoughts.

So animation is a point that I focus on on my website.

I have just learned how to use Figma to create some simple animations. If you want to create more powerful, interesting and advanced animations, you will need other software like Prototpie.

Creating animations is like drawing on a canvas what is going to happen at each step, from the first frame to the last frame, and finally connecting them through effects and adjusting the parameters.

In this assignment, I made almost all the effects myself.

For example, this island cat paw animation

First, make a normal island and cat's paw and put them in one frame. In the first frame, hide the cat's paw in the island. In the second frame, extend the cat's paw halfway and adjust the anchor point of the island to enhance the dynamic effect. In the third frame, extend the cat's paw fully and copy the second frame as the last frame.

Finally, add a rectangle to connect the main body, add triggers such as hover, and finally hide the rectangle fill. Set the delay in the prototype. The important point is that the delay time of each frame needs to be different to show a stronger sense of movement. Finally, connect the last frame back to the first frame to form a closed loop.

At the same time, I gave each work a name. These titles are also important to the viewers and the audience, so I added different effects to these three titles.

The first one is the elevator effect, the second one is the domino effect, and the third one is the masked effect.

I also like the jumping effects.

Shadows, forces, and bouncing motion curves are all important in this effect. I spent a long time debugging the motion curve before finally getting a satisfactory result.

Let me talk about something else, like the method I use in web page layout

ü§îI searched the Internet for the aesthetics of typography, such as the spacing between fonts. This is actually very important. It is related to the comfort of users and viewers. Even if the spacing is properly controlled, the design of the web page will be greatly improved. For example, most websites follow the multiples of even numbers (such as 4 and 8) as the setting. At the same time, the top and bottom content of the web page must not be too close, otherwise it will give people a feeling of being too crowded.

üßêAt the same time, the balance between the content and the text of the website is also extremely important. What is the proportion of the two that I want to present? 50% and 50%? Or 30% and 70%? This is a very interesting question, so I thought of many options, but finally chose the classic but not old-fashioned "line". The inspiration comes from the website of Hideo Kojima Studio, but I also changed some things and finally became my own version. When writing here, I suddenly thought of a paragraph in a literary work called "Rope", which is also quoted in Death Stranding.

"Ropes and sticks are the earliest tools invented by humans. Ropes can keep beauty, and sticks can drive away danger. Both are our earliest friends, and both were created by us. Wherever there are people, there are ropes and sticks."

Similarly, using lines to separate content and text can enhance the sense of design and interest, just like mirrors and glass, so I personally like this point very much, hahahaha
