__Let me talk about my entire web design process__

I don't want my webpage to be static and just sit there quietly like a book on a shelf. I want it to be dynamic and alive, and to convey my emotions, feelings and thoughts.

So animation is a point that I focus on on my website.

I have just learned how to use Figma to create some simple animations. If you want to create more powerful, interesting and advanced animations, you will need other software like Prototpie.

Creating animations is like drawing on a canvas what is going to happen at each step, from the first frame to the last frame, and finally connecting them through effects and adjusting the parameters.

In this assignment, I made almost all the effects myself.

For example, this island cat paw animation

First, make a normal island and cat's paw and put them in one frame. In the first frame, hide the cat's paw in the island. In the second frame, extend the cat's paw halfway and adjust the anchor point of the island to enhance the dynamic effect. In the third frame, extend the cat's paw fully and copy the second frame as the last frame.

Finally, add a rectangle to connect the main body, add triggers such as hover, and finally hide the rectangle fill. Set the delay in the prototype. The important point is that the delay time of each frame needs to be different to show a stronger sense of movement. Finally, connect the last frame back to the first frame to form a closed loop.
