Revisit the platform, context, and audience that you initially identified for your icons ?

For the platform of the icon, my keyword is system. Then I give it the context of social networking app. After all, most people use this kind of software on mobile phones. So for the platform, I chose mobile phones, including iOS and Android.


The design background of the icon. I hope it is modern and simple. In the early days of mobile phones, icons usually appeared in a realistic way. So I think it is a good idea to use simple lines to depict the shape of objects and add some lively colors.

I hope that the audience of icons should be very broad, including teenagers to middle-aged users. In order to attract and adapt to such a wide user group, icons need to have a certain degree of universality and ease of use. Therefore, moderate skeuomorphism is also necessary for icons. Users need to accurately and quickly understand the meaning of each icon.

Experiment with swapping out the existing images in the template with your own prototype icon designs
