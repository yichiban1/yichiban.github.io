I prefer the color scheme of Monochromatic because the keyword of the theme I want to design is system.

My goal was to design a set of icons that were consistent, simple, and focused on functionality, so the Monochromatic color scheme was a great choice. It maintains the overall harmony of the design while helping users focus on the meaning and functionality of the icons.

Finally, I think the mono chromatic color scheme is very easy to maintain consistency and it also makes it easier for me to do subsequent icon design.
