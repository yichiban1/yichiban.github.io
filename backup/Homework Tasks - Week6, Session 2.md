Review the homework tasks and blog entries that you have produced so far.

Speaking of the final adjustments, I didn’t actually finish in the last blog post. Mainly because I haven’t reached the final stage yet, so I’ll write a little more now.

In the final stage I make sure the icons can be displayed on the website and do a consistency check on the entire icon set to ensure that all icons are consistent in style, color, line thickness, etc.

_ Design Decisions_

• Functionality first: Consider the functionality of the icon first and ensure that each icon can intuitively express its corresponding function.

• Visual harmony: Use a consistent style and color scheme to ensure that the icon set blends seamlessly with the rest of the system or app.

（still Google hahaha But I think this can be used as an example of icon style unification）

• User experience: Pay attention to the readability of icons on different devices and backgrounds to ensure that users can quickly recognize and use these icons regardless of the usage scenario.

Summarize:

I wanted to make specific design decisions every step of the way to ensure the icon set had the best balance between functionality, visuals, and user experience.

（I wanted to add some sense of space and distance to the flat design icon, so I used gradients and transparency to make it look less😆boring and like other icons. In the final stage, I reduced the shadow so I hope🙏it is still within the scope of flat design.）

Thank you for reading my blog, Professor🙏🙏🙏
