Thumbnail Sketching Activity
This is the yerba mate🧉cup I drew

I like the second bird's-eye view. You can see the tea straws in the cup like pillars falling from the sky. It's very simple and the effect looks ok.

Sketch of the icon created for assignment 2

"Icons are a powerful form communication that can cross cultural and language barriers"(From slideshows)

I remember Elon Musk said at a blog summit two years ago that he hoped to use WeChat as a template to transform Twitter.(I don't know if this is true or false🤔)

To make a long story short, he felt that there was no such a unified application as WeChat in my hometown. You can post comments on WeChat, publish videos, and earn revenue from content creation.（WeChat is more like WhatsApp plus PayPal plus Instagram plus Twitter As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, WeChat's monthly active users reached 1.336 billion）

For the whole set of icons, I hope to give people a friendly feeling, so I will avoid making icons with edges and corners. Icons with arcs or round shapes will be better.

At the same time, texture is also what I want to emphasize. After all, it is a great thing🤩to be able to express the texture of an icon through the screen.

Regarding file backup, many companies also like to use the cloud. Maybe they want users to think that their backups are in the cloud☁️, so they are safer. So I hope to clearly describe the feeling of uploading and downloading. In the end, I may choose the one with the upload symbol☝️.

Regarding searching, I have looked for some inspirations online or simply looked at the designs of some companies, but most of them are magnifying glasses🔍, which is a bit boring. And I can't think of a particularly good alternative🕵️‍♂️. So I might replace it in the end. Maybe it would be nice to make a folder icon to go with the file back up.

If possible, I would like to use horizontal lines for the contact icon because it gives people a sense of stability. The contact icon should contain our relatives and friends, so if possible, avoiding overly square lines is also an option. It is also good to have some arcs or give some round feeling. I may choose the first icon.

The collection icon contains things we like or find useful, so it can be interpreted as a desire for knowledge. Vertical lines can be a kind of usage element. Its characteristic is demanding of attention. After all, we will definitely look for the content again after we collect🌟it. I might do the first one.

Regarding information icons, the first thing that comes to my mind is diagonal lines because it is energetic, implying impending change. We always have expectations and uneasiness about unknown news, so diagonal is a good choice. I might make it the fifth one.

Regarding the album icon, there are many styles when I was looking for it, such as a colorful windmill with a certain degree of transparency and a simple landscape outlined by lines. I want to use straight lines and some curves to depict the mountains. There is a small🗻hill behind the mountain with a sense of🌆sunset, and maybe a small sun on it.

The discover icon is essentially to check the latest updates from friends, so there are many things that can represent the🧭compass and the mysterious📦box. However, I want to use a curve to draw the planet icon because it gives people a feeling of exploring in space, and it would be best if it has a ring like Saturn🪐, so I should choose the fourth one.

Regarding wallets, I think the most commonly used👝wallet is the best representation. A slight curve can bring a sense of calm to the wallet icon. After all, everyone hopes that the money in their wallet is💳safe. I might choose the fifth one.
