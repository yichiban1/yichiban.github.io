Some sketches I drew about scenes from the movie Ran

In fact, there is no strict standard or rule to define the quality of a scene. Most of the time, people only rely on their own vision, hearing, taste, smell and touch, which are the five senses. Of course, the five senses are felt in real life. When the scene is put on the screen, things will change, right? You can place different objects in an old house and reflect the changes when the player walks through different positions. You can also bring some tranquility to the players and the experiencer in the open fields or grasslands.

The sense of direction is innate to humans. Of course, this is also the judgment made by humans based on their understanding of the scene. So, as I just said, the meaning of the scene also affects the player's judgment. For example, when we are in the parking lot, our first goal when we enter is to find a parking space and find an empty space. When we want to leave the parking lot, we will look for the place where we came in (exit) again.

So what I have to do is not to do things that go against common sense, that is, to let players understand the sense of space of the scene at a glance. Light and shadow and size can all limit and define the scene, so place different objects around the main object or highlight it as the main object. I hope that the main object gives people a sense of being high above, so using the surrounding objects to set it off is also something I will do. In addition, we can also make some changes to the road, such as making the road from narrow to wide or adding some doors. Through the perspective of the door, you can also see the existence of the main object.
