For assignment 3, my final choice should be Akira Kurosawa's movie Ran. （Akira Kurosawa shot four unique color films）

Kurosawa's movies actually gave me a lot of inspiration. When I was in junior high school, I actually liked watching movies. At first, it was Hollywood special effects movies, then art films, and then black-and-white movies. The first black-and-white movie I watched was actually Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars (Italian: Per un pugno di dollari). When I finished watching it, I felt that black-and-white movies were actually quite good, not as boring as I thought. Then I saw some comments on the Internet saying that this movie was actually plagiarized from Kurosawa's Yojimbo (Japanese: 用心棒,). So these movies reshaped my view of them.

I think these big and small things have also changed me from beginning to end. I remember a director once said that movies extend our lives three times. Maybe this is why I like movies and games.

I don't want players to feel lost when playing my game because I always get lost in 3D linear games, so reasonable path planning is necessary.

As I sketched before, I hope that the player can see the main object as soon as he enters. Just like Mario wants to save the princess and Frodo wants to drop the ring, they both have a clear destination (the castle), so enlarging the main object in proportion is what I will do.

When it comes to the design of the path, it can be a loop, a snake, a circle, or even a straight line, but I want it to be simple yet not simple, so maybe like the sketch I drew, I will put the main object in a higher position.

Finally, let's talk about landmarks and navigation. To be honest, I don't want my 3D environment to have clumsy big red arrows. Even in the last century, those game makers would not do that. So I hope that my 3D environment has some vitality, so that players can feel the existence of wind, just like in Kurosawa's movies. And I can also use grass to avoid using roads, let grass grow on both sides and leave the middle empty. In this way, even without conspicuous road signs, we can know where the road is.
