Kurosawa's movies actually gave me a lot of inspiration. When I was in junior high school, I actually liked watching movies. At first, it was Hollywood special effects movies, then art films, and then black-and-white movies. The first black-and-white movie I watched was actually Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars (Italian: Per un pugno di dollari). When I finished watching it, I felt that black-and-white movies were actually quite good, not as boring as I thought. Then I saw some comments on the Internet saying that this movie was actually plagiarized from Kurosawa's Yojimbo (Japanese: 用心棒,). So these movies reshaped my view of them.
