As a student who is new to illustrator, I think I will use shape tools, pen tool, path editing, alignment and distribution, color and gradient, transparency and blending modes in my work.

Design Thinking

Empathize
• Gather data and collect  data :gather user expectations and feedback on icons through interviews, questionnaires, or observations.
👍
Define 
• Problem definition: Based on the information collected, identify the core problem that needs to be solved when designing the icon.
👍
Ideate
• Mind Mapping: Use mind maps to organize and expand ideas and explore different design directions.
👍
Prototype
• Rapid prototyping: Create preliminary sketches or digital prototypes of your icon design.
👍
Test
• Functionality testing: Ensure the functionality and usability of icons on different devices and platforms.
👍
Implement
• Final design: Complete the final icon design based on the test results.

I originally had three ideas. The PlayStation system icon has simple lines that can tell the user what the icon is used for. I also thought of an icon for the weather app, but there are only a few types of weather, such as sunny, rainy, snowy, cloudy, etc. The other one is a game icon. I actually like this idea very much. I even drew a rough sketch. But recently I tried it and found that it is too difficult for me to challenge the game icon at my current level.

So recently I thought of social networking apps. Actually I think this is not bad. We use it almost every day. Think about the billions of people who use social networking apps in the world. What a huge user group. As for why I chose this theme, system, I think we use these apps every day, but when we are used to using it, we will forget about these icons and just rely on our subconscious to react to them. So I think you must be an excellent designer👨‍🎨to be able to make this feeling. Different functions in the app can become icons, so I want to design icons for it. The specific platform is the mobile phone. The background is some basic functions. The audience on the social networking app I hope is everyone, regardless of gender, age or young, but I hope the icon design is a little more interesting, so it may also be more inclined to a slightly younger group.
