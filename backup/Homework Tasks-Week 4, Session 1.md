As a student who is new to illustrator, I think I will use shape tools, pen tool, path editing, alignment and distribution, color and gradient, transparency and blending modes in my work.

👍
Define 
• Problem definition: Based on the information collected, identify the core problem that needs to be solved when designing the icon.
👍
Ideate
• Mind Mapping: Use mind maps to organize and expand ideas and explore different design directions.
👍
Prototype
• Rapid prototyping: Create preliminary sketches or digital prototypes of your icon design.
👍
Test

👍
Implement

I have three ideas. One is to make a playstation icon, but the system icon, but I haven't figured out what should appear after clicking the icon. The other is about weather, but there are many people who make weather, and there are many on the Internet, so I think it's hard for me to make a different one.

So I thought about the game icons. As for which game to choose, I wanted to choose a cultural background that I am familiar with. So Ghost of Tsushima should be a good choice. Artistic concept, tranquility, and inner heart can all become icons. So the specific platform I want to design the icon for is PlayStation, the background is video game UI, and the audience is people who like immersive games and less famous but interesting history.
