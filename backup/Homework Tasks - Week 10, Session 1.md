Answer the self reflection questions 

Assignment 1 - Video Edit
• How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of
your edit?

• In videos, sound is used to provide emotions and make the audience feel present, such as the texture of some objects matching a video clip, such as what the sound of keys dropped on a table should be, and some L cuts and J cuts. When the video switches to a new scene, the audience already has an expectation of what is about to appear through the audio. J cuts help create a sense of anticipation and smoothly guide the audience from one scene to another. They are often used to introduce new characters or scenes. L cuts help maintain continuity between scenes and make transitions more natural. They are often used to keep the dialogue flowing or show what is mentioned in the dialogue.

• How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?

• How to use video to create a self-portrait was a big problem for me at that time because I was no different from others, maybe there were some minor differences, so it was hard for me to figure out how to present my own uniqueness. I shot about 60 clips at that time. I really went to many places in those three weeks because I really didn’t know what to shoot, so I went out to look for it. My video clips might be when I was walking on the street and suddenly I thought of an idea and shot it. All my materials were shot in Melbourne. I think it was more like an adventure because I had just arrived here.

• What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how
did you apply this knowledge to your project?

• Sound is an important factor in the video. I hope it is non-narrative but also can provide strength to the video. In my video, I use L cut and J cut as well as some daily sounds such as washing hands, washing dishes and opening doors to enhance the texture of life.


• How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use
these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?

• Continuity is the most important thing for me in editing. I also hope to add some movement to the video through jump cuts. I put relatively static clips together, and put relatively large movements in the second half, and return to the quiet scene at the end.


• Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to
depict in your portrait?

• In my videos, I mainly depict my daily life, playing Go, cooking, and making mate tea. In the past, I wrote my name in a notebook and wrote my future expectations at the end. In terms of personality, I used the range of my movements to describe myself.


• What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your
work?

• Talking about the expression method, this really bothered me for a long time. I thought of many ways, such as expressing it in the third person, using my own shadow to express it, or even putting a paper bag on my head to express it. There are many more haha, but in the end I chose to focus on my own hands because we use our hands to do many things every day, just like typing my hands now, eating, making tea, and everything else. I watched some movies and drew how they depicted the feeling of hands. Unfortunately, because I was the only photographer, the effect was average. But I still like this concept very much. I think it can be used. Hands are a perfect representation of oneself.

Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons
• How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose
the theme that you did?

• The idea behind this set of icons I made was that I was trying to make an icon for a social application. The theme was system. I gave these icons a basic function and meaning, such as albums and contacts. I think the final effect is not bad. The reason why I chose this theme was actually mainly because of an article I read before about why there is no social application with all functions in Europe and the United States, like Instagram plus PayPal plus Twitter, so I wanted to try to make one.


• Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed
across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?

• Yes, I have thought about making another theme icon before, similar to the game, but there are many points in it that are difficult for me to present now, and I am not proficient in the software, so I changed another method to draw the icon.


• How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator?
Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?

• I started by looking at some designs by other people and some company proposals, blended them together, and drew sketches based on my own understanding. Then I tried different effects in illustrator and finally turned them into a set of icons without losing too much detail compared to the initial sketches.


• How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why
did you choose the palette that you did?

• I used non-obtrusive colors, such as blue and green for functionality, red for prompts, and gray for systems. In addition, I referred to the products of mature commercial companies. Then I considered how to distribute the colors reasonably, and finally they became the colors of my icons.


• How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design
correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?

• The process is actually quite similar to the video. Sound gives people a feeling. It is a way to provide emotional power and texture. So I hope to add some sounds that are not abrupt to give people a sense of texture and reality. Just like I added the sound of turning pages to the collection function, which is very common but rarely heard. At the same time, I also used some electronic sounds to simulate our daily reminders.


• How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of
concrete visual designs?

• First, I need to thoroughly understand what this abstract idea means. Then I research related topics to find inspiration. This may include looking at similar designs, artwork, colors, shapes, and styles. Then I brainstorm to turn the abstract ideas into specific keywords or concepts. I draw preliminary sketches to turn the ideas into visual forms. At the same time, I think about how to convey emotions and information through these elements. Finally, I use software to create prototypes.

Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment
• How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that
process?
• How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment
differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional
media?
• What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and
different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?
• How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your
use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?
• How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme
or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?
• What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have
discovered otherwise?
