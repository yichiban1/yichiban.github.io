Answer the self reflection questions 

Assignment 1 - Video Edit
• How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of
your edit?

• In videos, sound is used to provide emotions and make the audience feel present, such as the texture of some objects matching a video clip, such as what the sound of keys dropped on a table should be, and some L cuts and J cuts. When the video switches to a new scene, the audience already has an expectation of what is about to appear through the audio. J cuts help create a sense of anticipation and smoothly guide the audience from one scene to another. They are often used to introduce new characters or scenes. L cuts help maintain continuity between scenes and make transitions more natural. They are often used to keep the dialogue flowing or show what is mentioned in the dialogue.

• How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?

• How to use video to create a self-portrait was a big problem for me at that time because I was no different from others, maybe there were some minor differences, so it was hard for me to figure out how to present my own uniqueness. I shot about 60 clips at that time. I really went to many places in those three weeks because I really didn’t know what to shoot, so I went out to look for it. My video clips might be when I was walking on the street and suddenly I thought of an idea and shot it. All my materials were shot in Melbourne. I think it was more like an adventure because I had just arrived here.

• What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how
did you apply this knowledge to your project?

• Sound is an important factor in the video. I hope it is non-narrative but also can provide strength to the video. In my video, I use L cut and J cut as well as some daily sounds such as washing hands, washing dishes and opening doors to enhance the texture of life.


• How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use
these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?

• Continuity is the most important thing for me in editing. I also hope to add some movement to the video through jump cuts. I put relatively static clips together, and put relatively large movements in the second half, and return to the quiet scene at the end.


• Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to
depict in your portrait?

• In my videos, I mainly depict my daily life, playing Go, cooking, and making mate tea. In the past, I wrote my name in a notebook and wrote my future expectations at the end. In terms of personality, I used the range of my movements to describe myself.


• What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your
work?

• Talking about the expression method, this really bothered me for a long time. I thought of many ways, such as expressing it in the third person, using my own shadow to express it, or even putting a paper bag on my head to express it. There are many more haha, but in the end I chose to focus on my own hands because we use our hands to do many things every day, just like typing my hands now, eating, making tea, and everything else. I watched some movies and drew how they depicted the feeling of hands. Unfortunately, because I was the only photographer, the effect was average. But I still like this concept very much. I think it can be used. Hands are a perfect representation of oneself.

Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons
• How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose
the theme that you did?
• Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed
across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?
• How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator?
Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?
• How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why
did you choose the palette that you did?
• How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design
correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?
• How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of
concrete visual designs?
